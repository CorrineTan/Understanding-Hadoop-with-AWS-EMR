## Basics
- HDFS - distributed, fault tolerant, high throughput file system.
- Hardware failure is a norm not an exception (on average, harddrive last for 3 years - 1/1000).
- Streaming data access rather than interactive access by user.
- Large Data Sets (hundred of terabytes and perabytes).
- Simple Coherency Model - write-once-read-many access model, and read is always sequencial.
- Moving computation is cheaper than moving data.
